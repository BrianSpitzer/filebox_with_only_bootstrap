# Filebox with Only Bootstrap

In this project, we'll practice using Bootstrap. The goal in this phase is to **only** use:

 - pre-written Bootstrap classes and components, e.g. unstyled lists and the navbar
 - the vertical spacing classes that I've already included for you

Therefore, you shouldn't have to write any CSS rules yourself for this phase; just apply the ones that Bootstrap and I have provided.

## [Here is your target.](https://filebox-with-only-bootstrap.herokuapp.com/landing.html)

## Setup

1. Fork this repository to your own account.
1. [Create a Cloud 9 Workspace as usual.](https://guides.firstdraft.com/getting-started-with-cloud-9.html)
1. Run the `bin/setup` command in a Terminal.
1. Run Project.
1. Navigate to the homepage of the app in a Chrome tab.
1. Open `public/index.html` in the editor.

## Suggested Steps

 1. I have already downloaded and included Bootstrap in the project for you.
 1. I have also included an `additional_styles.css` with some standard vertical spacer classes.
 1. There are `<link>`s to both in the `<head>` of your starting point, but they are commented out. Uncomment them to use them.
 1. Use [Shoelace.io](http://shoelace.io/) to create a skeleton grid for your layout, and then copy-paste it into your page.
 1. Plug in your content to each cell in your skeleton. You can copy-paste from the target if you want to.
 1. I've already downloaded all of the images that you need. You'll find them in the folder `public/assets/images`, which means you can use them like this:

        <img src="/assets/images/hero.png">

 1. You should be able to exactly match the target by only applying existing classes from either `bootstrap.css` or `additional_styles.css`; **you need not write any CSS rules yourself**.
 1. You can draw "inspiration" from the target, and any page on the Internet, by Viewing Source: Ctrl+U on Windows or Option+Cmd+U on Mac.
